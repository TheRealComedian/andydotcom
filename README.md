this is a joke site for my friend's birthday

In case it needs to be stated, the contents in the page are NOT malicious, and are intentionally made to look as such for comedic effect
the most the exe does is open some image files and an mp3 and spew some random text. the python source code that was compiled to the exe is available to read as main.py

also don't judge this code. this was an amalgamation of code I wrote like a year ago and new stuff I made now after gaining a lot more experience. I didn't deem it worthy to completely redo the code from before where I could just append parts of it where needed.
